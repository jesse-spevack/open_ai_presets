# Instructions
I am going to share some writing with you. 

I would like you to revise this writing. Your suggestions must be based on the book "On Writing Well" By William Zinsser, the key points of which I've summarized below.

## On Writing Well Summary

### Simplicity
Your suggestions should strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what should be revised in favor of simplicity.

### Clutter
I need your suggestions to remove clutter. Clutter is the laborious phrase that has pushed out the short word that means the same thing. For example, "At the present time we are experiencing precipitation." should be decluttered into "It is raining."

#### Favor short words to long
I need your suggestions to favor short words to long. For example, "assistance" should be "help". Here are some additional examples:
numerous -> many
facilitate -> ease
remainder -> rest
initial -> first
implement -> do
sufficient -> enough
attempt -> try
referred to as -> called
due to the fact -> because
with the possible exception of -> except
for the purpose of -> for
until such time as -> until
and so on.

### Word choice
When choosing words and stringing them together, bear in mind how they sound. Such matters as rhythm and alliteration are vital to every sentence. A typical example of rhythm and alliteration put to good use:
> And don't scorn that bulging grab bag Roget's Thesaurus. It's easy to regard the book as hilarious. Look up "villain," for instance, and you'll be awash in such rascality as only a lexicographer could conjure back from centuries of iniquity, obliquity, depravity, knavery, profligacy, frailty, flagrancy, infamy, immorality, corruption, wickedness, wrongdoing, backsliding and sin. You'll find ruffians and riffraff, miscreants and malefactors, reprobates and rapscallions, hooligans and hoodlums, camps and scapegraces, scoundrels and scalawags, jezebels and jades.

### Target Audience
The target audience for this writing is made up of my teammates and coworkers. The reader should be assumed to be a person with an attention span of about 30 seconds. This person is assailed by many forces competing for attention. Brevity and clarity of writing is therefore critical to effective communication.

## Detailed Instructions
The suggestions should have the following format.
- Write out the full revision so it is easy to copy and paste.
- List each misspelled word along with the proper spelling. If there are no spelling mistakes, you should write "lgtm :)" under the spelling section.
- List each individual revision. Each revision in the list should include the original sentence, the suggested revision, and an explanation of how the revision improves the sentence.

## Output Format

Your output should be structured as JSON with the following schema:

```json
{
  fullRevision: "A full revision for easy copy and pasting",
  spelling: [
    {misspelledWord: 'dum', properSpelling: 'dumb'}
  ],
  revisions: [
    {
      originalSentence: "The original sentence",
      revisedSentence: "The revised sentence",
      reason: "An explanation of how the revised sentence improves the original."
    }
  ]
}
```
## Everything after this new line is the writing I'd like you to revise.
